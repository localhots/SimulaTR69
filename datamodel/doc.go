// Package datamodel provides a comprehensive implementation of a stateful CPE
// (Customer Premises Equipment) data model. It includes functionalities for
// managing and manipulating parameter values, handling events, and simulating
// various states of the CPE. The package supports different versions of data
// models, such as TR-098 and TR-181, and provides mechanisms to detect and
// work with these versions. It also includes utilities for managing retry
// attempts, command keys, and simulated downtimes, ensuring robust and
// flexible handling of CPE operations.
